Simple project that takes text file with one integer per line and counts the
inversions in the file.

Inversion: When a number is in the text file in a relative position to other
numbers that is opposite of its relative position in the natural order of
integers

ex.) [1,3,4,2] = has 2 inversions with 2 being inverted with 3 and 4

Merge_Sort.py = uses "divide and conquer" algorithm to sort a list
    (can be any type of list)
count_inv.py = counts inversions from a list
    (can be any type of list)
count_inv_txt_file.py = counts number inversions in a txt file for integers only
    (can uncomment line 13 to print original unsorted list)
textinv.txt = test file, has 13 inversions
